The hospital comprises six departments spread over three floors. The network design ensures:

Segmentation of LAN, WLAN, and VoIP traffic using VLANs

Secure remote access via SSH

Efficient routing with EtherChannel and trunking

Redundancy with backup servers

Integration with simulated AWS cloud services

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
